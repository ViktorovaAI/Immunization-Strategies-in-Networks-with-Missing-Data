# Immunization-Strategies-in-Networks-with-Missing-Data
This package contains the code for final project in Analysing Networks "Immunization Strategies in Networks with Missing Data" prepared by A. Viktorova, D. Williams

As the base for the project the study of Immunization Strategies in Networks with Missing Data by Rosenblatt, Smith, Gauthier and H ́ebert-Dufresne (2020) was used. This study was further extended by adding eigenvector and pagerank centrality measures as immunization strategies to the experiment. Additionally, configuration model instead of exponential random graph models (ERGM) was used to generate “synthetic networks”. For every series of experiments with a fixed centrality measure and a fixed error-level the immunization robustness and “traditional” robustness as defined by Martin & Niemeyer (2019) were computed.
